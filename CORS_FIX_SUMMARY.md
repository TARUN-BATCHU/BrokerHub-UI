# CORS Issue Fix - Cross-Device Access

## Problem
When accessing the application from other devices (phones, laptops) on the same WiFi network, static pages loaded but API calls failed with CORS errors.

## Root Cause
The `public/config.js` file was using `window.location.origin + '/BrokerHub'` which created absolute URLs. When the React app is built and served from the backend's static folder, it needs to use relative URLs instead.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed API Configuration
**File:** `public/config.js`

**Changed from:**
```javascript
window.APP_CONFIG = {
  API_URL: window.location.origin + '/BrokerHub'
};
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
window.APP_CONFIG = {
  API_URL: '/BrokerHub'
};
```

This ensures that API calls use relative paths, which will work correctly regardless of the device accessing the application.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build the React App
```bash
npm run build
```
✅ **Completed** - Build successful

### Step 2: Copy Build to Backend
Copy the contents of the `build` folder to your backend's static folder:

```bash
# Example path (adjust according to your backend structure)
# Copy from: d:\VsProjects\BrokerHub-MultiUser--UI\build\*
# Copy to: [Your Backend Project]\src\main\resources\static\
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server
Restart your Spring Boot backend server running on port 8080.

### Step 4: Test Access
1. **From your computer:** http://localhost:8080
2. **From other devices:** http://[YOUR_IP]:8080
   - Example: http://192.168.1.100:8080

## How to Find Your IP Address

### Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)

### Alternative Method:
- Open Command Prompt
- Type: `ipconfig | findstr IPv4`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login works from other devices
- [ ] Dashboard loads with data
- [ ] API calls succeed (check Network tab in browser)
- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] All features work as expected

## Technical Details

### API Configuration Priority
The `api.js` file uses this priority for API base URL:
1. `window.APP_CONFIG.API_URL` (from config.js) ✅ **Now uses relative path**
2. `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` (from .env files)
3. `/BrokerHub` (fallback)

### Why This Works
- Relative URLs (`/BrokerHub/api/...`) automatically use the current host
- When accessed from `192.168.1.100:8080`, APIs call `192.168.1.100:8080/BrokerHub/api/...`
- When accessed from `localhost:8080`, APIs call `localhost:8080/BrokerHub/api/...`
- No CORS issues because same origin

## Additional Notes

### For Development Mode (npm start)
If you want to test in development mode from other devices, use:
```bash
npm run start:mobile
```
Note: Update the IP in package.json `start:mobile` script to match your current IP.

### Backend CORS Configuration
Your backend should already have CORS configured to allow requests. If you still face issues, verify your Spring Boot CORS configuration allows:
- Origins: `*` or specific IPs
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Headers: Authorization, Content-Type

## Troubleshooting

### If API calls still fail:
1. Clear browser cache on the device
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify backend is accessible: http://[YOUR_IP]:8080/BrokerHub/
4. Check firewall settings on your computer
5. Ensure both devices are on the same network

### If static files don't load:
1. Verify build folder was copied correctly to backend static folder
2. Check backend static resource configuration
3. Restart backend server

## Success Indicators
✅ No CORS errors in browser console
✅ Network tab shows successful API responses (200 status)
✅ Login and all features work from any device on the network
✅ API calls use relative paths (visible in Network tab)
