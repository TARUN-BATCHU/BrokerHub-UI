# Authentication Session Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The React frontend was not maintaining authentication sessions between API requests. After successful login, subsequent API calls were being treated as anonymous requests, causing authentication failures.

## Root Cause
The axios HTTP client was not configured to include session cookies (`withCredentials: true`) in API requests. This meant that:

1. Login request succeeded and server set session cookies
2. Subsequent API calls didn't include these session cookies
3. Server treated each request as unauthenticated
4. API calls failed with 401/403 errors

## Solution Applied

### Fixed File: `src/services/api.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  withCredentials: true,  // ‚Üê This line was added
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Includes Session Cookies**: All API requests now automatically include session cookies
2. **Maintains Authentication State**: The session established during login persists across all subsequent requests
3. **Works with CORS**: Compatible with the existing CORS configuration on the backend
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

## Technical Details

- **axios version**: 1.3.0 (supports `withCredentials` option)
- **Configuration scope**: Global for all API requests through the centralized axios instance
- **Browser compatibility**: Works with all modern browsers
- **Security**: Maintains secure cookie handling as configured by the backend

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Flow**: Verify login works and redirects to dashboard
2. **API Calls**: Confirm that dashboard loads broker data successfully
3. **Session Persistence**: Check that refreshing the page maintains authentication
4. **Logout**: Ensure logout properly clears session

## Files Modified

- `src/services/api.js` - Added `withCredentials: true` to axios configuration

## No Additional Changes Required

The fix is minimal and focused:
- No changes needed to individual API calls
- No changes needed to React components
- No changes needed to authentication context
- No changes needed to backend CORS configuration

This single-line change resolves the session management issue across the entire application.
